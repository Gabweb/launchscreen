# Launchscreen  - Your web organizer on steroids!

Store, manage and organize your frequently visited websites. Inspired by the 'new tab' page of firefox, Launchscreen aims to provide a better user experience and greater functionality.

## Current State

Currently, this project is in a Proof-of-Concept state. The planned features are the following:

* Store the configuration locally (no account needed).
* Store the configuration in our cloud. (Login via third-party service, e.g. GitHub)
* Firefox and Google Chrome add-on - replaces the default new tab page.

## Development

The frontend relays on [Fontawesome Pro](https://fontawesome.com/pro). To build this project you'll need a FontAwesome Pro license.
